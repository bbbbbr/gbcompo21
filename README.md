## Prize pool

The current prize pool is **$3000** and will be split according to [this document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/196vIZGLbSk1ewzRnZc7Dy_LJdPQpfJUg-udT4iyBVOg).

Entries will compete in 4 separate categories and 4 rankings will be drawn up. Based on these leaderboards, the top entries will be awarded as follows:

- Best games (80% of the prize pool)
  - The best 5 games will get a prize.
  - The best 3 OSS games will get an additional prize (can overlap)
- Best homebrew/tool (1) (running on a GB/GBC)
- Best music cartridge (1)
- Best demo (1)

The rankings are decided according to the [JUDGING](#JUDGING) criteria.
 
GitHub is the preferred way, as it will match your amount (if your account is not new), **doubling** the effect on the prize pool!

### Open Source Bonus

If you publish your game source code and assets on a public repository (e.g. GitHub) under [an open source license](https://choosealicense.com/) (GPL, MIT, Apache, CC0...) you get **20%** more of the prize as a bonus!

*Prize tiers are still work in progress, expect changes. Money prizes are subject to fees and conversions. They may be delivered as gift cards of your choice.*

## Rules

1. Final entry "deliverable" must consist of a GB or GBC ROM file. You can also attach descriptive documents in TXT, Markdown or HTML file format (e.g. game manual).
2. The ROM file will be tested on real hardware (usually a DMG or a GBC) and on the BGB emulator. In case of different results, the hardware test will be the trusted one.
3. GBC features are allowed.
4. SGB features are allowed. The entries will be evaluated mainly on Game Boy (Color). You can use SGB features, but don't rely on them as main features for your entry.
5. Teams are allowed (award will be split).
6. The competition is focused on *games*, but you are allowed to submit *homebrew tools*, *demos* and *music cartridges*. There may be special category prizes for those. There are no preferred themes.
7. ROM Hacks are not allowed.
8. NSFW content is not allowed. Please keep it safe for work and avoid anything overly edgy or distasteful. 
9. You can submit more than one entry. They will be rated separately, but each person or team may only accept prizes on behalf of a single entry (e.g., you can't win both the 1st and 2nd place prize).
10. Judges can submit entries, but they are not eligible for prizes.
11. ROM size must be compliant to [known MBCs](https://gbdev.io/pandocs/MBCs.html). MBC5 or MBC3 are recommended for compatibility reasons. No MBC is allowed too (32k).
12. Entries cannot rely on extra hardware or add-on devices, they must be playable without a specific setup.
13. As long as you produce a GB or GBC ROM file that runs on GB/GBC, any tool to develop the entry is allowed. This includes RGBDS (ASM), GBDK (C), ZGB (C), GB Studio, ...
14. Source code is optional, but very much appreciated. Entries submitted with source code (public repositories on GitHub/GitLab/... are accepted) and with an open source license (GPL, MIT, Apache, CC0 for code, any CC for assets) are eligible for **additional** prizes. Make sure to fill the "Open Source repository" field with a valid and public repository when submitting on itch.io. See [this issue](https://github.com/gbdev/gbcompo21/issues/3) for further details.
15. The entry must be submitted on the itch.io jam page.
16. Your work must be new and original. You cannot enter with something you were already working on before the start of the jam. The majority of work should be done during the jam. If in doubt, please ask us before proceeding.  
    Examples of things that are **allowed:**  
    - A brand new game using your own (or any) existing game engine.
    - A remake of your (or someone else's) game for a different platform, but with new code and assets.
    - A brand new game you barely started (e.g. you only made a title screen or a mockup of the gameplay).

    Examples of things that are **not allowed:**  
    - A project you've been working on for months.
    - An update/patch for a game you already released publicly.

## Judging

Judges will evaluate submissions using the following criteria:

1. **Gameplay** - How entertaining are the gameplay mechanics? How fun is the game?
2. **Technical** - How innovative is it from a technical perspective? Does it push the hardware to the limit?
3. **Originality** - How refreshing is it from a non-technical perspective? Does it have a unique design / mechanics?
4. **Graphics**  -  How impressive are the art, animation and visual effects?
5. **Audio**  -  How good are the music and sound effects?

Criteria applicability:

- Games are ranked according to all the listed criteria
- demos on 2,3,4,5
- Music entries on 5
- Homebrew/tools entries on 2 and 1 (with gameplay being UX)

The leaderboards are computed by averaging the "Overall" score.
