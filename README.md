## PRIZE POOL

The current prize pool is <X> and will be split according to the following table: <PRIZES_TABLES>.

The entire prize pool is community funded. You can donate any amount you wish through the following platforms:

- [GitHub sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/avivace?editing=true&frequency=one-time). 
- [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/gbdev?language=fr)
 
GitHub is the preffered way, as it will match your amount (if your account is not new), doubling the effect on the prize pool!

### OPEN SOURCE BONUS

If you publish your game source code and assets on a public repository (e.g. GitHub) under an open source license (GPL, MIT, Apache, CC0) you get **20%** more of the prize as a bonus!

*Prize tiers are still work in progress, expect changes. Money prizes are subject to fees and conversions. They may be delivered as gift cards of your choice. The open source bonus applies to the monetary part of the prize, even if you get two (e.g. an entry wins the 4th place + the most technically impressive prize, 20% is applied on 60+50)*
