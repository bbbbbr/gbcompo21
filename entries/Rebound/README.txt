                     REBOUND
     A bouncy platform game for Game Boy Color
 
              = THE STORY SO FAR... =

    One day, our hero Boink was having a nice day out
with his girlfriend Ploink. Suddenly, an evil wizard
appeared and kidnapped her! Not only that, but the
wizard cast a wicked spell on Boink that caused him to
bounce uncontrollably!
    
    The wizard disappeared with Ploink just as suddenly
as he appeared, but not before dropping a strange map
amidst all the confusion. The map led to an ancient
Maztactl temple - this must be the wizard's hideout!

    And so, Boink decides to set off on a voyage to the
mysterious temple. Will he be able to break the spell
and reunite with his girlfriend?

                  = GENERAL TIPS =
- It pays to master the wall bounce technique! Simply
  hold A plus the direction of the nearest wall and you
  will automatically climb up it. You never know what
  you might find with this move!
- Holding down the B button will also let you slide down
  walls. Use this to your advantage to squeeze your way
  into tight gaps.
- Having trouble bouncing up a staircase with a low
  ceiling? Try letting go of the A button - you won't
  bounce around as much that way.
- Enemies that are above water can be defeated simply
  by bumping into them from above. If you do this while
  holding the A button, you'll be able to bounce much
  higher than normal!
- Try pressing the Select button on the title screen!
